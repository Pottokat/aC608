White part

Core board has 124 pad
85 two-way general IO
5 pairs of LVDS IO (can be used as two-way general IO)
1 pair LVDS clock input IO
12 clock input IO (not including LVDS clock input IO)
5 GND (hardware connected)
4 VDD3.3 input (hardware connected)
1 VDD2.5 output
1 VDD1.2 output
4 JTAG IO

Board has 50MHz clock, input from E15 
Board has W25Q16, 16M SPI Flash, compatible with EPCS16
The IO covered by SDRAM  are all independent, not shared with any stamp holes IO


Green part
Clock input signal can only be used as clock or regular signal, can not be used as output, doesnâ€™t support pull up or down.
When not used, recommend ground. Also 92 and 93 can be used for LVDS clock input.

Pink
LVDS functional pin, if you need to use LDVS pin you need to make sure core board R9 empty welding, R8 uses 0R or Ferrite bead short circuit.
If using for general IO, then R9 needs to use 0R resistor or R8 empty welding (this is default factory setting for core board)

Grey
All GND is connected

Red
VDD3.3 is external 3.3v input power. Powered by base board(?), all VDD3.3 are connected.
VDD2.5 voltage output, can be used as low power output to base board, e.g. powering the JTAG
VDD1.2 voltage output, can be used as low power output to base board
